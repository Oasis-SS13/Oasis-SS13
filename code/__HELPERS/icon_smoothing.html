    <p>Each tile is divided in 4 corners, each corner has an appearance associated to it; the tile is then overlayed by these 4 appearances. To use this, just set your atom's 'smooth' var to 1. If your atom can be moved/unanchored, set its 'can_be_unanchored' var to 1. If you don't want your atom's icon to smooth with anything but atoms of the same type, set the list 'canSmoothWith' to null; Otherwise, put all types you want the atom icon to smooth with in 'canSmoothWith' INCLUDING THE TYPE OF THE ATOM ITSELF.</p>
<p>Each atom has its own icon file with all the possible corner states. See 'smooth_wall.dmi' for a template.</p>
<h3>DIAGONAL SMOOTHING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<p>To make your atom smooth diagonally you need all the proper icon states (see 'smooth_wall.dmi' for a template) and to add the 'SMOOTH_DIAGONAL' flag to the atom's smooth var (in addition to either SMOOTH_TRUE or SMOOTH_MORE).</p>
<p>For turfs, what appears under the diagonal corners depends on the turf that was in the same position previously: if you make a wall on a plating floor, you will see plating under the diagonal wall corner, if it was space, you will see space.</p>
<p>If you wish to map a diagonal wall corner with a fixed underlay, you must configure the turf's 'fixed_underlay' list var, like so:</p>
<pre><code>fixed_underlay = list(&quot;icon&quot;='icon_file.dmi', &quot;icon_state&quot;=&quot;iconstatename&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>A non null 'fixed_underlay' list var will skip copying the previous turf appearance and always use the list. If the list is not set properly, the underlay will default to regular floor plating.</p>
<p>To see an example of a diagonal wall, see [/turf/closed/wall/mineral/titanium] and its subtypes.</p></main>
